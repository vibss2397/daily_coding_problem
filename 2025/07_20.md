## Problem 1 (graph, dfs):
200. Number of Islands
Medium

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

solution:
```python

class Solution(object):
    def get_neighbors(self, i, j, grid):
        lis = []
        options = [(i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i+1, j), (i-1, j)]
        for opt in options:
            if (opt[0] < 0 or opt[0] >= len(grid)) or (opt[1] < 0 or opt[1] >= len(grid[0])):
                continue
            lis.append(opt)
        return lis

    def process_neighbors(self, neighbors, grid):
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            i, j = neighbor
            if grid[i][j] == "1":
                grid[i][j] = "-1"
                new_neighbors = self.get_neighbors(i, j, grid)
                self.process_neighbors(new_neighbors, grid)

    def numIslands(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        island_count = 0
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    neighbors = self.get_neighbors(i, j, grid)
                    self.process_neighbors(neighbors, grid)
                    island_count += 1
                    grid[i][j] = "-1"
                elif grid[i][j] == "-1":
                    continue
                elif grid[i][j] == "0":
                    continue  
        return island_count
```

## Problem 2 
133. Clone Graph
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:


Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
Example 2:


Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
Example 3:

Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
Node.val is unique for each node.
There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

Solution (unpolished, can improve)
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

class Solution(object):
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        """
        :type node: Node
        :rtype: Node
        """
        if node is None:
            return None
        def helper(node, processed):
            val = node.val
            if val in processed:
                return processed[val]
            if not node.neighbors:
                return Node(val)
            neighbors_list = []
            new_node = Node(val)
            processed[val] = new_node
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                new_neighbor = helper(neighbor, processed)
                neighbors_list.append(new_neighbor)
            new_node.neighbors = neighbors_list
            return new_node
        processed = {}
        return helper(node, processed)
```

## Problem 3
721: Accounts Merge

Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Output: [["John","john00@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com","johnsmith@mail.com"],["Mary","mary@mail.com"],["John","johnnybravo@mail.com"]]
Explanation:
The first and second John's are the same person as they have the common email "johnsmith@mail.com".
The third John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: accounts = [["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe3@m.co","Gabe1@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co","Kevin0@m.co"],["Ethan","Ethan5@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan0@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo3@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo0@m.co"],["Fern","Fern5@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern0@m.co"]]
Output: [["Ethan","Ethan0@m.co","Ethan4@m.co","Ethan5@m.co"],["Gabe","Gabe0@m.co","Gabe1@m.co","Gabe3@m.co"],["Hanzo","Hanzo0@m.co","Hanzo1@m.co","Hanzo3@m.co"],["Kevin","Kevin0@m.co","Kevin3@m.co","Kevin5@m.co"],["Fern","Fern0@m.co","Fern1@m.co","Fern5@m.co"]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= accounts.length <= 1000
2 <= accounts[i].length <= 10
1 <= accounts[i][j].length <= 30
accounts[i][0] consists of English letters.
accounts[i][j] (for j > 0) is a valid email.

solution:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts):
        """
        :type accounts: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        email_to_name = {}
        graph = {}

        for account in accounts:
            name, emails = account[0], account[1:]
            for email in emails:
                email_to_name[email] = name
                if email not in graph:
                    graph[email] = []
                for email2 in emails:
                    if email != email2:
                        graph[email].append(email2)
        
        final_res = []
        visited = set()
        def dfs(email, component):
            if email in visited:
                return
            component.append(email)
            visited.add(email)
            for neighbor in graph[email]:
                dfs(neighbor, component)

        for email in email_to_name:
            if email not in visited:
                component = []
                dfs(email, component)
                final_res.append([email_to_name[email]] + sorted(component))
        return final_res
```
